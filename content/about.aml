[+.body]
    I‚Äôm a designer and creative technologist interested in making beautiful digital experiences that bring clarity to complex topics. 
    
    I currently work as a graphics editor at the New York Times, where I design and build interactive applications, graphics, maps, games, and other internet gizmos. Before that, I worked at small design studios specializing in information design.

    My work has received a [Peabody award](https://peabodyawards.com/award-profile/inside-the-deadly-maui-inferno-hour-by-hour/) and has been recognized by the Society for News Design, the National Press Foundation, and the National Press Club. Coronavirus tracking tools I helped design were part of a package that won the 2021 Pulitzer Prize for public service journalism.
