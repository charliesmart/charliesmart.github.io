[+.body]
    I‚Äôm a developer and designer interested in making sense of complicated data, concepts, and stories. 
    
    I currently work as a graphics editor at the New York Times, where I make interactive graphics, maps, games, and other internet gizmos. Before that, I worked at small studios specializing in information design.

    My work has received awards from the Society for News Design. Coronavirus tracking tools I worked on were part of a package that won the 2021 Pulitzer Prize for public service journalism.

    I like to spend time outdoors, rock climb, and play the guitar.
